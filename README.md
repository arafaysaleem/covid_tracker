Covid Tracker is an Android app made with **Flutter** framework to provide worldwide information related to Covid-19 pandemic. The intended use of this app is to provide the public with honest and easy-to-navigate information regarding Covid-19. Providing users with this information can help lessen the spread of Covid-19 and inform users about how to stay safe.

The api used for the data can be found [here](https://corona.lmao.ninja/docs/). **The release apk is available under the release tags. It's also available on this drive link - [Covid Tracker APK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xazOX_VaaAPzuccusj-hk0zsPZaomDLc?usp=sharing)**
